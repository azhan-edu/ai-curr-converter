New Feature

I need to add a "Refresh Rates" button to the currency converter.
Ask me clarifying questions to understand the requirements.

====

Great—before implementing “Refresh Rates”, I need a few details to avoid wrong behavior.

Clarifying questions
Trigger behavior

Should the button force-fetch fresh rates immediately, bypassing the 1-hour cache?
Or should it only re-run conversion using current cached rates?
Scope of refresh

Refresh only the currently selected currency pair?
Or refresh all rates for the selected base currency?
Provider strategy

On refresh, should we still use the same fallback provider chain (primary → secondary)?
If primary fails, should UI indicate fallback was used?
UI placement

Where should the button appear (next to Convert, near rate display, header, etc.)?
Should it be visible on initial load or only after first conversion?
Loading/disabled state

Should button show a spinner/text like “Refreshing…”?
Should Convert + inputs be disabled while refresh is in progress?
Result update

After refresh, should we automatically update the displayed converted amount?
Should we also append this action to conversion history, or avoid history pollution?
URL/query params

Any new query param needed (e.g., refreshedAt) or keep current URL behavior unchanged?
Error UX

Preferred message when refresh fails?
Should previous successful rate remain visible if refresh fails?
Rate metadata

Do you want to display “Last updated at …” and/or provider source in UI?
Testing expectations

Do you want coverage for: loading state, success update, fallback path, and refresh failure recovery?
If you want, I can next propose a concrete implementation plan (files + tests) once you answer these.


======

1.
Implement both cases in this way: create env variable for cache duration time. If it equals 0 (zero) page should be refreshed immediately.
2.
Refresh only the currently selected currency pair.
3.
App should use the same fallback flow
4.
Put this Refresh Rates button to the separate section/palel 'refresh rates panel' above the rate display panel
This button should be visible when Amount more then zero?
5.
Button should show a spinner/text like “Refreshing…”?
Convert + inputs should be disabled while refresh is in progress
When refresh completed notification popup "Currency rates are refreshed" should be displayed.
6.
After refresh, we should automatically update the displayed converted amount
We should not update the history
7.
No
8.
If refresh fails we should show message: Currency rates refresh failed.
Previous successful rate remain visible if refresh fails.
9.
Yes. Put this last rates update data to the 'refresh rates panel'
10
Testing expectations are the same as for all project


##Additional clarifications:
Cache env value unit is likely seconds.
Yes - “Visible when Amount more than zero” interpreted as: show refresh button only if amount > 0.
There is a tailwindcss in the project - use its Notification component

### More clarifications
- Currency Rates panel should be implemented as a separate component
- add to the currency rates panel a collapsible subpanel with the rates source info (basic URL) and a table with all loaded currency rates
- DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS chould be initialy defined and configurable via .env file
