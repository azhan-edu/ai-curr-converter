## Getting Started

1. **Review the Reference Guide** — Read [Copilot Best Practices](copilot-reference.md) for context management and shortcuts
2. **Pick a Challenge by Level** — Start with 🟢 Beginner challenges if you're new
3. **Complete → Compare** — Follow the challenge steps, then checkout the branch to compare your solution

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd training-currency-converter
npm install

# Compare with solution (optional)
git checkout customisation  # or any challenge branch
```

## Learning Path

We recommend to start with **Project Creation** to understand how this app was built, but it's optional task(main branch has all the needed code to start from 2-challenge-customisation). Complete each challenge using the docs, then optionally check the branch for the reference solution.
